                    <p>At a workshop at the <a href="https://www.pdc2020.org/">2020 Participatory Design Conference</a> in Manizales, Colombia, we will collaboratively explore how cooperative labour, social justice, and economic inclusion movements can be supported and extended by new technologies while simultaneously promoting greater balance with environmental sustainability and regeneration efforts in local communities. We will use and build upon the open technologies and inclusive design methods of projects such as the <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Platform+Cooperative+Development+Kit">Platform Cooperative Development Kit</a>, the <a href="https://www.sojustrepairit.org/">Social Justice Repair Kit</a> and other community-based efforts.</p>

                    <p>If you're interested in participating in the workshop, we welcome applications in the form of a one minute video that describes your work and why you're interested in participating.</p>

                   <p>We will accept applications until April 15, and  participants notified on April 30th at the latest, to permit adequate time for travel arrangements.</p>
